## Algorithms

The **Major Five topics** are:-

1. Implementation Problems
2. Programming Paradigm(Greedy, backtracking, branch and bound, DP, Divide and Conquer, Brute force etc.)
3. Graph Theory(directed, undirected, weighted, rooted(IN & OUT) and unrooted tree, DAG etc.)
4. Math(Number theory, Computational Geometry, Combinatorics, Linear Algebra etc.)
5. Others(String Processing, Bit Manipulation etc.)

### Implementation Problems

> - Practice, Practice and Practice!

### Programming Paradigm

> #### Understand Recursion

  Dijkstra, Prim's and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning tree are just Greedy Algorithms or backtracking is just DFS with branch pruning with condition. Try to solve many questions related to tree, specifically binary tree(and also n-ary tree). And also solve at least 20 questions with tag BFS and DFS in Leetcode.
